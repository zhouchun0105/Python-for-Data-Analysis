**Lambda Functions**: has no name when defining it, and it is contained in one line of code. You give the function a value (argument) and then provide the operation (expression).

**Signiture of a function**: the function header and its parameters.

A function can return multiple values by returning a tuple. You can access tuple by index.

**Scope**: part of the program where an object or name may be accessible.

* Global scope: defined in the main body of the script
* Local scope: defined inside the function
* Built-in scope: names in the pre-defined built-ins module

**Global**: modify the variable outside of the current scope. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.

**nonlocal** used in inner functions to state the value of variable is applicable to outer function.

The searching order is: local scope, enclosing functions, global, builtins.

'*args' for arbitrary number of parameters
